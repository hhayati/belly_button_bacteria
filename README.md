# belly_button_bacteria
A dashboard is created to visualize the bacterial data obtained by sampling from a few hundred volunteers to identify the bacteria species colonizing in their belly button. The user can access a drop-down menu to select the volunteer id. The data include: 
* Demographic information for the selected volunteer, 
* A bar chart showing top 10 bacterial species found in the volunteer’s belly button, 
* A bubble chart showing the bacteria species found in the volunteer’s belly button
* A gauge chart showing the weekly washing frequency.
